== Description

You can use the `retry` policy to replay requests when experiencing backend connection issues or if the response meets a given _condition_.

If the retry takes too long, relative to the `timeout` value, the request stops.

NOTE: To replay a request with a payload, the gateway stores it in memory. We recommend you avoid applying it to requests with a large payload.

=== Policy identifier

You can enable or disable the policy with policy identifier `retry`.
